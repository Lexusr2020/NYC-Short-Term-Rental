# NYC Short-Term Rental

Welcome to Pillow Palooza, a dynamic start-up poised to revolutionize the traditional real estate market with its focus on short-term rental options for travelers. With the surging demand for short-term rentals in New York City, Pillow Palooza is primed to optimize its business strategy by gaining a deeper understanding of the market landscape.

Having collected extensive data from various sources on Airbnb listings across the city, Pillow Palooza is ready to embark on a journey of analysis and discovery. Our goal is to uncover key insights that will empower the company to maximize revenue and occupancy rates for its short-term rental properties.

I was tasked you with spearheading a project that involves collecting Airbnb listing data from multiple sources, cleaning it, and conducting a comprehensive analysis. Through this analysis, we aim to identify trends in popular neighborhoods, rental prices, property types, length of stay, and demand over time.

The insights gained from this analysis hold immense potential to inform Pillow Palooza's strategic decisions and drive growth and success in the competitive short-term rental market of New York City. Join me on this exciting journey as we leverage data-driven insights to shape the future of Pillow Palooza and redefine the short-term rental experience.
